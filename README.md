Using an RNA-seq dataset from NCBI, we identified 8,112 differentially expressed genes, including 951 significant upregulated genes in AML patients. 
Of these, 185 were mapped to KEGG pathways, 18 were linked to the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, and 3 drugs were repurposed for 18 of those genes.

Tools and platforms: NCBI, R studio, and DGIdb
